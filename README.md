# Xlib
Xlib is a dynamic file analysis and listing system. It does this using the python/flask framwork. Well, how can I use this? Just run the flask server and transfer the files you want to share to the static/documents folder. You can leave the rest to Xlib and it will take care of it. By the way, don't forget to out the flask server from development mode!
